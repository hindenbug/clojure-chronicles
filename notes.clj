;; Clojure and Functional Programming

;; Clojure is homoiconic, i.e clojure code is composed of data
;; uses prefix notation
;; data structures are immutable


;; Six Rules of Clojure FP

;; 1. Avoid direct recursion
;; 2. User 'recur' when producing scalar values or small fixed sequences
;; 3. When producing large or variable sized sequences, always be lazy
;; 4. Dont use lazy sequence more than needed
;; 5. Konw the sequence library, you can write code without using lazy API's at all
;; 6. Subdivide. Divide even simple problems into smaller pieces
